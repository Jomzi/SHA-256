How to run this project
---
To run this project you can either download a C compiler or set up a vitual machine on Google Cloud Platform. I will attach links to both below: 
<ul><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart-linux/" rel="nofollow">Google Cloud Platform</a></li>
<li><a href="www.mingw.org/" rel="nofollow">C compiler</a></li></ul>

1. When you are setup in your C environment you can download this project or do a git clone from this repository.

2. You will need to install GGC, if it's not already there. To install GGC type the follow command: sudo apt-get install build-essential

3. To compile the program use: gcc SHA256.c -o SHA256

4. Then excute it by using:
